\description{
BinSpect (Binary Spatial Extraction of genes) is a fast computational method
that identifies genes with a spatially coherent expression pattern.
}
\details{
We provide two ways to identify spatial genes based on gene expression binarization.
Both methods are identicial except for how binarization is performed.
\itemize{
  \item{1. binarize: }{Each gene is binarized (0 or 1) in each cell with \bold{kmeans} (k = 2) or based on \bold{rank} percentile}
  \item{2. network: }{Alll cells are connected through a spatial network based on the physical coordinates}
  \item{3. contingency table: }{A contingency table is calculated based on all edges of neighboring cells and the binarized expression (0-0, 0-1, 1-0 or 1-1)}
  \item{4. For each gene an odds-ratio (OR) and fisher.test (optional) is calculated}
}
Other statistics are provided (optional):
\itemize{
  \item{Number of cells with high expression (binary = 1)}
  \item{Average expression of each gene within high expressing cells }
  \item{Number of hub cells, these are high expressing cells that have a user defined number of high expressing neighbors}
}
By selecting a subset of likely spatial genes (e.g. soft thresholding highly variable genes) or using multiple cores can accelerate the speed.
